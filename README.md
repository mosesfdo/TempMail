## 📦 **How to Run Locally**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mosesfdo/TempMail.git
   cd TempMail
   ```

2. **Open in browser**:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```
   Or simply double-click the `index.html` file.

> **No build tools or dependencies required** - pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

## 🔮 **Future Learning Goals**

- [ ] Integrate with real email APIs (Mail.tm, MailDrop)
- [ ] Add real-time email fetching
- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Add dark mode with CSS custom properties
- [ ] Explore TypeScript for better type safety
- [ ] Learn about service workers for offline functionality

## 📚 **Resources That Helped**

- MDN Web Docs for HTML/CSS/JS reference
- CSS Grid and Flexbox tutorials
- JavaScript ES6+ features
- API design principles
- Responsive design best practices

## 🧑‍💻 **About This Project**

This was created as a **learning exercise** to understand:
- How web applications are structured
- How frontend technologies interact
- How APIs work (even though this uses mock data)
- Best practices in modern web development

The goal was to build something functional while learning the fundamentals that would apply to any web development project.
